            <h2>Alternate study environments</h2>
            <p>
                Study in the library, in the cofee shop, in your room,...varying the
                place you study helps you remember more.
            </p>

            <h2>Mix content</h2>
            <p>
                Study a bit of this, a bit of that, some this again, some of the other.
                Switching content helps you remember more.
            </p>

            <h2>Space study sessions</h2>
            <p>Three one-hour sessions is more effetive than one three-hour session.</p>

            <h2>Self-testing</h2>
            <p>Test yourself, or have a buddy do it. It helps you know how well you know.</p>
